# Blockchain-using-Javascript

Hello there!

This project is made for JavaScript code practice or educational purpose. This is currently under formation, as only the BlockChain part of the project is made.

Every code-line has a descriptive comment(s) plus SUMMARY of the method/function to provide with logic. 

Thank you for looking into it! 

Best regards,


Uswa R.
