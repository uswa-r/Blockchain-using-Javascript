# Blockchain-using-Javascript

Hi there! :D

I practiced this JavaScript project for fun and educational purpose, as I'm an enthusiastic and motivated programmer, who loves to play and experiment with the coding languages.

Every code-line has a descriptive comment(s), plus a SUMMARY of the methods/functions to provide the respected reader with the elaborated logic and better understanding.

Thank you for looking into it! :)

Best regards,
